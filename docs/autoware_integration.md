## How to integrate Agnocast to Autoware

Basically, take a look at the first Autoware integration Pull Request <https://github.com/tier4/autoware.universe_tmp-agnocast/pull/2>

There are two steps for Agnocast to work with Autoware:

### Step 1: Add Agnocast dependencies

For CMakeLists.txt (`target_library` should be replaced with the corresponding target):

```c++
find_package(agnocastlib REQUIRED)
...
ament_target_dependencies(target_library agnocastlib)
target_include_directories(target_library PRIVATE
  ${agnocastlib_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
```

For launch.xml ( `AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE` can be configured based on how much the process will consume heap memory, see [shared memory](./docs/shared_memory.md) for more detail.):

```xml
<env name="LD_PRELOAD" value="libagnocast_heaphook.so"/>
<env name="AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE" value="134217728"/>  <!-- 128MB -->
```

For packages.xml:

```xml
<depend>agnocastlib</depend>
```

### Step 2: Replace ROS 2 APIs for Agnocast APIs

The declarations and initializations should be replaced like the following:

```c++
// rclcpp::Publisher<MessageType>::SharedPtr message_pub_;
// message_pub_ = this->create_publisher<MessageType>("/topic_name", rclcpp::QoS{x});

std::shared_ptr<agnocast::Publisher<MessageType>> message_pub_;
message_pub_ = agnocast::create_publisher<MessageType>("/topic_name", rclcpp::QoS{x});
```

```c++
// rclcpp::Subscription<MessageType>::SharedPtr> message_sub_;
// message_sub_ = node_.create_subscription<MessageType>("/topic_name", rclcpp::QoS{x}, callback);

std::shared_ptr<agnocast::Subscription<MessageType>> message_sub_;
message_sub_ = agnocast::create_subscription<MessageType>("/topic_name", rclcpp::QoS{x}, callback);
```

### Other tips

- Until the subscription callback thread is integrated into ROS 2 executor, all callback functions should be guarded with mutex lock.
- Although Agnocast already has `get_subscription_count()` API, it is not still complete. There is an issue ticket <https://github.com/tier4/agnocast/issues/181>.
- Agnocast does not support `publish_if_subscribed()` API yet. There is an issue ticket <https://github.com/tier4/agnocast/issues/164>.
