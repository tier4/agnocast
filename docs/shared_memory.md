## What is shared memory in Linux?

See official man page: <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/shm_overview.7.html>

## How shared memory is used in Agnocast?

### Basic usage

- A publisher opens a shared memory with a writable privilege.
- A subscriber opens the shared memory with a read-only privilege which the corresponding publisher opened.

### Detailed usage

There are three invocations for shared memory related procedures.

#### Initialization of a process

Each process linked with Agnocast opens a shared memory, which is writable only for the process.
When a process first calls malloc or other memory related functions, Agnocast starts and the shared memory is opened in the following steps:

1. get an allocatable area through `AGNOCAST_ADD_PROCESS_CMD` ioctl.
2. open a writable shared memory on the allocatable area, with `shm_open`, `ftruncate` and `mmap` system calls.
3. create a thread and open a message queue so that the process can recognize a emergence of a new publisher later.

#### Creation of a publisher

When a process calls `create_publisher` for a topic `T`, the shared memory of the process should be mapped by processes which have a subscription for `T`.
Thus the following procedures are executed:

1. The publisher process gets the information about subscribers already registered for the topic `T` through `AGNOCAST_ADD_PUBLISHER_CMD` ioctl.
2. The publisher process opens a message queue and send the shared memory information in order to notify the subscribers already created for the topic `T` that a new publisher is registered.
3. The subscriber process receives the message and maps the publisher's shared memory area with a read-only privilege.

#### Creation of a subscriber

When a process calls `create_subscription` for topic `T`, then the process maps the corresponding publisher's shared memory area with a read-only privilege in the following steps:

1. get the information about the publishers for the topic `T` through `AGNOCAST_ADD_SUBSCRIBER_CMD` ioctl.
2. map the publisher's shared memories with a read-only privilege.

### Naming rule and restrictions

In Agnocast, there is exactly one writable process and there are some read-only processes for a shared memory.
Suppose the writable process's id is `pid`, then the shared memory is named as "/agnocast@pid".
The name should start with '/' and should not include '/' any more.

Message queue is also created for each process.
Suppose the process's id is `pid`, then the message queue is named as "/new_publisher@pid".
The restriction for the name is the same as the shared memory.

## How to determine `AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE` value

Any process which joins Agnocast has to set `AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE` as an environment variable.
The passed value is aligned to 100KB boundaries.

`AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE` represents the size of the writable Virtual Address Space (VAS) mapped into the process’s own address space.
This VAS is backed by shared memory.
Due to demand paging, physical memory is allocated only upon the first access (first touch) of a page.
Therefore, the shared physical memory corresponding to `AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE` is not allocated all at once.

In the [original paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16882) and its corresponding prototype implementation ([sykwer/agnocast](https://github.com/sykwer/agnocast)), all heap allocations are redirected to this shared memory.
In contrast, in the [tier4/agnocast](https://github.com/tier4/agnocast) implementation, not all heap allocations are redirected to shared memory.
Ideally, only objects referenced by `agnocast::ipc_shared_ptr` should be placed in shared memory, while all other allocations should reside in the process-private heap.
However, since it is difficult to fully achieve this in practice, the implementation is designed to approximate this ideal as closely as possible.
Those interested may refer to the `agnocast_get_borrowed_publisher_num()` function in `agnocastlib` and `agnocast_heaphook`.
The current approach is that heap allocations occurring between the `AgnocastPublisher::borrow_loaned_message()` call and the subsequent `AgnocastPublisher::publish()` call are redirected to shared memory.
This is because it is not possible to determine exactly when, within this interval, a heap allocation for an object referenced by `agnocast::ipc_shared_ptr` will occur.

Given the above implementation, it is difficult to determine an appropriate size for `AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE`.
Due to demand paging, the shared physical memory corresponding to `AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE` is not consumed in full from the beginning.
Therefore, as long as the virtual address space resources are not exhausted, it is safer to allocate a much larger size.
The virtual address space resources are managed in [agnocast_kmod/agnocast_memory_allocator.h](https://github.com/tier4/agnocast/blob/main/agnocast_kmod/agnocast_memory_allocator.h), and the ranges defined in this file are arbitrarily chosen.

## Known issues

- When a heaphook fails to allocate a memory due to the lack of enough memory pool, heaphook tries to add a new memory. However, the added area will not be mapped by the subscribers in the current implementation and in turn Agnocast will not work well.
- The current implementation suppose that the memory after 0x40000000000 is always allocatable, though it is not investigated in detail.
