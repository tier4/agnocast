Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: A heap runtime replacement for Agnocast.
 To achieve true zero-copy communication with Agnocast, message objects must be placed in shared memory. Therefore, all heap allocation and deallocation operations are intercepted and customized using LD_PRELOAD hooks.
